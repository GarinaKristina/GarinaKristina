      About me ☘️
       </h3>
  </p>
    <h align="left"> 
      I am originally from Belarus, now I living in Lithuania. <br>
      <p>
      I graduated from the Belarusian-Russian University in the <br>
      city of Mogilev, majoring in economics in banking, finance and credit.<br>
       12 years of experience in finance, business cases, analysis, statistics.<br>
    </p>
      <p> 
      At my previous place of work, I came up with and implemented a<br>
      functionality that reduced the time and, accordingly, the cost of an accountant by 5 times.<br>
      I automated the processes that were associated with uploading from one desktop application <br>
      to another desktop application, which were not previously related to each other. <br>
    </p> 
     <p> 
      Then one day, I realized that I want to try something new.

      My journey to become a Software Test Automation Engineer 💻
       </h3>
       <p>
        <h>
And so, one fine day, I decided to change my life and went to QA Automation in javascript courses at Epam Systems. <br>
I went through all the modules, passed the English test, chose the programming language, did all the homework...<br>
After the course, I already got an internship at Epam Systems, where a team of three people wrote a framework for<br>
an online store using WebdriverIO, cucumber, Jest for API. We created test cases, estimate them, distributed Jira <br>
tickets to each other.<br>
