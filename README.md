    <h3 align="left"> <u>  About me ☘️</u></h3>
  </p>
    <h align="left"> 
      I am originally from Belarus, now I living in Lithuania. <br>
      <p>
      I graduated from the Belarusian-Russian University in the city of Mogilev, majoring in economics in banking, <br>
      finance and credit. <u>12 years of experience in finance, business cases, analysis, statistics.</u><br>
    </p>
      <p> 
      At my previous place of work, I came up with and implemented a functionality that reduced the time and, <br>
      accordingly, the cost of an accountant by 5 times.<br>
      I automated the processes that were associated with uploading from one desktop application to another desktop <br>
      application, which were not previously related to each other. <br>
    </p> 
     <p> 
      Then one day, I realized that I want to try something new.

    <h3 align="left"><u>My journey to become a Software Test Automation Engineer 💻</u></h3>
    <p>
    <h>
And so, one fine day, I decided to change my life and went to QA Automation in javascript courses at Epam Systems. <br>
I went through all the modules, passed the English test, chose the programming language, did all the homework...<br>
<p>
After the course, I already got an internship at Epam Systems, where a team of three people wrote a framework for<br>
an online store using <u>WebdriverIO, Cucumber, Jest for API</u>.
 We created test cases, estimate them, distributed Jira <br>
tickets to each other.<br>
</p>
    </h>
    </p>
  <p>
  After a successful internship, I went through several stages of the interview and <b>I FINALLY GOT MY FIRST OFFER</b> 🎉🎉🎉
