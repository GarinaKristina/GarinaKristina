<p>
       I am originally from Belarus, now I living in Lithuania. I graduated from the Belarusian-Russian University in the city of Mogilev, majoring in economics in banking, finance and credit. 12 years of experience in finance, business cases, analysis, statistics.

At my previous place of work, I came up with and implemented a functionality that reduced the time and, accordingly, the cost of an accountant by 5 times.

I automated the processes that were associated with uploading from one desktop application to another desktop application, which were not previously related to each other.

Then one day, I realized that I want to try something new and here I am.
